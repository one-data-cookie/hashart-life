# hashart-life

Inspired by [Aleksandr](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/144-shades-of-gray/)
and [Jordan](https://hash.jordanscales.com/), I created my own generative hashart --
a PF 2025 card with a [SHA3-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)
and [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)-hashed greeting on a 32x32 grid,
which then evolves throughout the year as a
[Game of Life cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Implementation

- Generates a grid of hashed "PF 2025" text
- Evolves it as a Game of Life throughout the year
- Flows through seasonal colors to make it pretty
- Creates PNG images and a GIF animation

Also, the GIF was too slow, so I sped it up through [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/speed).
